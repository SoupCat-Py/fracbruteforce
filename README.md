# fracbruteforce
goes through thousands of iteations to find equivalent fractions for any rational number (so it can repeat but not something like pi)

The TI version seems to have a really hard time checking if it found the result because it often skips right over the answer. <br/>
I've ran the same code on a computer and it does not have any trouble, so the problem seems to be with the calculator's version of python.
